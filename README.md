# Presents App

This is a website i created to present the present for my girlfriend's 25th birthday.

It is predominately a static site despite being served via Tomcat (embedded Web Container/HTTP Listener) using Spring Boot framework.

### Technologies

- HTML
- CSS/ Bootstrap
- JS/ JQuery
- Java
- Spring Boot

### Development

I choose to serve it using Spring Boot on Tomcat as a means to experiment/practice of spinning up a
web app built using Spring Boot with the ability to serve static content using WebJars.

### Run Locally

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

then hit 

http://localhost:8080/

### Demo

website is deployed onto Heroku cloud platform and can be accessed via the following link:
